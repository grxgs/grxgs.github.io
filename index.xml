&lt;h1 id=&#34;week-1-review&#34;&gt;Week 1 Review&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re following the &lt;a href=&#34;http://grxgs.com/blog/what-im-learning-and-timeline/&#34;&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt; I set in my last post, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that week 1 is finally complete. Week 1 went surprisingly well. In the first four chapters, we covered setting up python, variables, lists, tuples, strings, basic numerical operations, and looping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting Python set up on my machine was no problem. Instead of doing everything on my machine locally, I opted to use a virtual machine. I&amp;rsquo;m using the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. I&amp;rsquo;ll be upgrading to 16.04 LTS sometime next week. Having my entire environment on a virtual machine is a lot easier for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel more comfortable testing and making changes on a system that&amp;rsquo;s entirely separate from what I use everyday. I used to work with the command line quite a lot so everything is very familiar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flip side to this is that I needed to completely configure a command line environment. Fleshing out my .bashrc file has been a fun exercise as I remember all of the CLI shortcuts and CLI programs that are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In regards to actual Python, the chapters have been fairly easy. The difficult part of this is reacquainting myself with Python&amp;rsquo;s syntax. While it is readable the fact that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really used it or read it in several years is obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easy part though has been remembering the concepts of everything. Variables are just a way of storing data in a way that makes them easier to access and use later. Lists and tuples are just containers for different types of data. Looping is just a construct that allows us to perform iteration really easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that the concepts are coming back so easily is really driving me to read and get through all of the exercises in each chapter. So much so that I&amp;rsquo;ve already read Chapter 5 well before I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to. Hopefully, week 2 goes just as well or better than week 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What I&#39;m learning and its timeline</title>
      <link>http://grxgs.com/blog/what-im-learning-and-timeline</link>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;intro&#34;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, it would be useful to layout exactly what I plan on learning. Having everything laid out and planned makes it easier to keep progressing. This timeline will be for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll primarily be focusing on learning (or relearning) the Python programming language. To accomplish this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be following &amp;ldquo;Python Crash Course&amp;rdquo; by Eric Matthes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose this particular book mainly for Part II of the book which is focused on 3 different types of projects. Along with that, each chapter ends with several exercises to reinforce the lessons. For anyone curious, I&amp;rsquo;ll be using Python 3 to go through the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;timeline&#34;&gt;Timeline&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 1 - 5: Chapters 1 - 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 6 - 10: Chapters 5 - 8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 11 - 15: Chapters 9 - 11&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 16 - 20: Chapters 12 - 14 (Project 1)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 21 - 25: Chapters 15 - 17 (Project 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Days 26 - 30: Chapters 18 - 20 (Project 3)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the table of contents for &amp;ldquo;Python Crash Course&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who remember learning programming this timeline is obviously aggressive. The reason this timeline is so aggressive is because I have previous programming experience. In Python at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These 30 days will serve more as a reintroduction to the world of programming and Python. I&amp;rsquo;ll be posting updates every 5 days. However, you will see commits over on my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grxgs&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; everyday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and keep this short and simple. I&amp;rsquo;m just a simple person whose trying to get into software development. Along with that, I&amp;rsquo;m also trying to improve my physical and mental health. If you want to know anything else, just reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Post!</title>
      <link>http://grxgs.com/blog/first-post</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kudos for stumbling upon this blog and more specifically this post. I&amp;rsquo;m not one for very long worded and fancy intros. So this will be a relatively short post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog has a few purposes. The main purpose is to have somewhere to record my hopefully mildly entertaining life experiences. You probably just asked yourself what type of life experiences might you expect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this will focus on a two things really. First is my goal towards becoming employed as a software developer. I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with technology in some capacity (more than less) for the past 7 years. After trying out a variety of roles, I figured I give software development an actual shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly is my fitness journey. As a desk jockey and former Pepsi enthusiast I am not in the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; shape I could be. After realizing that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to get in shape sooner than later figured I start now. As opposed to waiting until I&amp;rsquo;m in my 40s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the other purposes of this blog is hopefully serve as some motivation (for myself and others)as I progress. As time goes by, it would be great to look back at my former self and see how I&amp;rsquo;ve changed and improved. Along with that, it would be great if this blog convinced just one other person to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, there isn&amp;rsquo;t much more for me say. The next few posts you&amp;rsquo;ll see will talk about what I plan on learning and learning plan. Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;grxgs&lt;/li&gt;
